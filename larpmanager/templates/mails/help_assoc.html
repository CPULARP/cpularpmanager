<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
    I'm Mauro, the developer of LarpManager. I saw you created an organization and wanted to ask how your experience has been so far.
</p>
<p>
    If you have feedback or specific needs, let me know - I'm happy to make adjustments or develop new features to fit your workflow.
</p>
<p>If you prefer, we can also set up a call to go over the platform together and answer any questions.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
    <em>Mauro</em>
</p>
