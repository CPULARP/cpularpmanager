                Hello there! My name is Mauro Scanagatta. I have been programming for more than half of my age, I have a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, and I love organizing LARPs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can already imagine what happened: since I hated spending time in the tedious and time-consuming tasks (like managing accounting, signups, character sheets), I started developing a software.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was supposed to be a simple and easy project... but over the years, I continued adding more and more features.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, I thought that maybe the tools that I've created for myself, could be useful also for others. So that's the story of Larp Manager!
