            <strong>LarpManager is free and open source</strong> - no limits, no hidden fees, and no premium tiers.
            You can use it as a hosted service or run your own instance. This flexibility is at the heart of our mission:
            empowering LARP organizers of all sizes with powerful tools, without financial barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're planning a small one-shot or managing a complex, persistent campaign, you have two ways to use the platform:
        </p>
        <h3>Use the hosted version</h3>
        <p>
            The easiest way to get started is by using our hosted platform here at
            <a href="https://larpmanager.com" target="_blank">larpmanager.com</a>. It's ready to go - no setup required!
        </p>
        <h3>Self-host your own instance</h3>
        <p>
            LarpManager is fully open source and available on
            <a href="https://github.com/loskana/larpmanager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            Youâ€™re free to install and run it on your own server. Just make sure to follow the licensing terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The project is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" target="_blank">AGPL-3.0</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you self-host, include a visible link to <a href="https://larpmanager.com" target="_blank">larpmanager.com</a> in every page of the interface
            </li>
            <li>
                If you modify the platform and make it accessible to others (e.g. via web), you must make your version's source code available
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content policy</h3>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or remove access to the hosted platform for events
            that include offensive, discriminatory, or otherwise harmful content.
            Let's keep LARP inclusive and respectful for everyone.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            LARP is about storytelling, immersion, and community. We believe technology should support that - not restrict it.
            <br>
            This project exists thanks to our love for LARP, and we intend to keep it that way: open, accessible, and available to all.
        </p>
