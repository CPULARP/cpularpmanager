            <strong>LarpManager is free and open source</strong> - no limits, no hidden fees, and no premium tiers.
            You can use it as a hosted service or run your own instance. Our mission is simple: <i>help everyone run a LARP.</i>
        </p>
        <h3>Use the hosted version</h3>
        <p>
            The easiest way to get started is by using our hosted platform here at
            <a href="https://larpmanager.com" target="_blank">larpmanager.com</a>. It's ready to go - no setup required!
        </p>
        <h3>Self-host your own instance</h3>
        <p>
            Youâ€™re free to get the code on
            <a href="https://github.com/loskana/larpmanager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
            install and run it on your own server. You can choose between two licenses:
        </p>
        <h4>AGPL-3.0</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You need to include a visible link to <a href="https://larpmanager.com" target="_blank">larpmanager.com</a> in every page of the interface
            </li>
            <li>
                If you modify the code and make it accessible to others (e.g. via web), you must make your version's source code available
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Commercial</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>No need for attribution, and for publishing code changes. Contact us for further info.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content policy</h3>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or remove access to the hosted platform for events
            that include offensive, discriminatory, or otherwise harmful content.
            Let's keep LARP inclusive and respectful for everyone.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            LARP is about storytelling, immersion, and community. We believe technology should support that - not restrict it.
            <br>
            This project exists thanks to our love for LARP, and we intend to keep it that way: open, accessible, and available to all.
        </p>
