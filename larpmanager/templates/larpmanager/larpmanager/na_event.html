    <p>Heya! You requested an advanced feature of the larpmanager, but we couldn't find an event that you manage.</p>
    <p>
        Maybe someone already created the event? In this case ask them to add you to one of the roles in order to help them manage it!
    </p>
    <p>
        If the event does not exists yet, <a href="{% url 'exe_events' %}">click here to create one</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Need help? <span class="contact-mail"></span></i>
    </p>
